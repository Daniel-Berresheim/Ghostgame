# Ghostgame

Planned Features:

new object doors, trapdoors, switches, buttons and pressure_plates:
- all objects are not possessable or movable
- have a color code, doors open, if signals with the same color are active
- if there are more than one signal emitter at the same time, they will work like they are linked with an OR, if at least one gives a signal, the doors will open
1) buttons:
- attached to walls 
- can be activated by humans
- emit signals for a short period of time
2) switches:
- attached to walls
- can be activated and deactivated by humans
- emits signals if activated
3) pressure_plates:
- attached to the ground
- can be activated by movables and humans by walking on it
- emit signals as long as there is an object on it
4) doors and trapdoors:
- doors are three blocks tall and trapdoors are three blocks wide
- if a signal emitter with the same color is active, they will open
- can be inverted, that you have to give a signal to close them
- there should be an iron version of this doors, where the ghost cannot pass through them
5) later, there should be other doors, which only open, if the player collected a specific amount of items
6) later, there should be special switches, which can be pressed by the ghost and change properties of the whole world (e.g. activate/deactivate lights in the house)

object human:
- dying: the player falls over with an animation and sound; the screen fades out and the level resets
- some humans have other abilities, which are shown on the sprite; e.g. cannot be possessed
- will be scared of some actions of the player and from movables and run away
- maybe they have a value of how likely they are to be afraid
- this value can be raised if it's dark, etc. and through events
- adults could have a higher resistance to scary things
- can activate switches and buttons
- humans can collect pumpkins, if every human got a pumpkin, the map is cleared and will be brighter
- ladders, possessed humans can climb on them

keyhint interface:
- show controller keys while using a controller
- while possessing an object, show all available controlls

object behaviour:
- movables should apply their movement to other movables, who are stacked above them
- movables should be able to push other movables with ca. half the normal movement speed

light system:
- light shouldn't add infinite on objects

sound behaviour:
- the direction from which the sound comes should be relative to the ghost instead of the middle of the screen

others:

- save system for pumpkin points, cleared levels and current position of the player
- objects like a clock, a thermometer or paintings, which can be manipulated; this could have effects on the real world
